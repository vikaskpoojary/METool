App Name: METool

1. Data Collection and Usage
METool does not collect personal user data. However, the app may access and process the following information within Revit:

Project metadata (e.g., file name, project number)

Element properties (e.g., category, ID, geometry)

User actions (e.g., selections, warnings processed)

This data is used solely for automation and workflow enhancement. No data is transmitted externally or stored beyond the active Revit session.

2. Third-Party Data Handling
METool does not share data with third parties. If future versions integrate analytics or SDKs, all third-party services will be required to match the protections outlined in this policy, including:

No unauthorized data collection

No external transmission without user consent

Full compliance with regional data protection laws

3. Data Retention and Deletion
METool does not retain user data beyond the current session. All processed information is ephemeral and tied to the active Revit environment. No logs, caches, or external backups are created.

4. User Consent and Data Deletion
Since METool does not collect or store personal data, no consent is required for usage. If future updates introduce optional data features, users will be able to:

Opt-in via clear UI prompts

Revoke consent at any time

Request deletion of any stored data via in-app settings or support contact
